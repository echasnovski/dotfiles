# All of the configurations behavior adjust various metrics determined by the
# font. The values can be integers (1, -1, etc.) or a percentage (20%, -15%,
# etc.). In each case, the values represent the amount to change the original
# value.
#
# For example, a value of `1` increases the value by 1; it does not set it to
# literally 1. A value of `20%` increases the value by 20%. And so on.
#
# There is little to no validation on these values so the wrong values (i.e.
# `-100%`) can cause the terminal to be unusable. Use with caution and reason.
#
# Some values are clamped to minimum or maximum values. This can make it
# appear that certain values are ignored. For example, the underline position
# is clamped to the height of a cell. If you set the underline position so
# high that it extends beyond the bottom of the cell size, it will be clamped
# to the bottom of the cell.
#
# `adjust-cell-height` has some additional behaviors to describe:
#
#   * The font will be centered vertically in the cell.
#
#   * The cursor will remain the same size as the font.
#
#   * Powerline glyphs will be adjusted along with the cell height so
#     that things like status lines continue to look aligned.
